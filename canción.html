    <h1><strong><u>Hello</u></strong></h1>
    <h2><i><sup>por Adele</sup></i></h2>
    <h3>Letras:</h3>
    <p><em>Hello</em>, it's <strong>me</strong><br>
        I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
        To go over everything<br>
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello, can you hear me?<br>
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
        When we were younger and free<br>
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
    </p>
    <p>
        There's such a difference between us<br>
        And a million miles
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello from the other side
    </p>

    <p>
        I must've called a thousand times<br>
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello from the outside<br>
        At least I can say that I've tried<br>
        To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello, how are you?<br>
        It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
        I hope that you're well<br>
        Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
    </p>

    <p>
        It's no secret that the both of us<br>
        Are running out of time
    </p>

    <p>
        So hello from the other side (other side)<br>
        I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)<br>
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello from the outside (outside)<br>
